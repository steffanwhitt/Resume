                   creative solutions when we have parts shortages.Electrical Machine Responsible - Worked with production, quality and process to make the chain run more efficiently by 
                   implementing automation modifications. I also was on call for any issues the crews would have on long down time events. Planned work for PMs and administered training 
                   on the equipment.<br>
                    Machine Responsible - On the Ultraflex machine I made modifications to it so it was easier to operate and worked closely with quality/process tech to make the machine 
                    produce more uniform tires. I also planned the PM work to be done on the equipment.<br>
                    Crew Troubleshooter - Worked on crew attending to reactive calls. Where I learned about the cycles of the machine and how to do all the setups on the equipment as

            <h4>Bosch Rexroth</h4>
            <h4>Maintenance Technician (August 2019 - October 2020)</h4>
                <p>Respond to reactive calls for the assembly lines. We assembled hydraulic pumps and I worked with the Test stand maintenance team often learning about how the pumps work and 
                   how we test them. I worked with Cognex Insight explorer to tweak our cameras to pick up barcodes inside the pumps to ensure we are putting it together correctly. I also made
                   small modifications to the HMIs and PLC to improve the line's function. I worked with engineering to develop prototype on the line and worked with SQL server our database for 
                   leak rates on the pumps. With my machining background I would create parts for the line if needed as well as create parts for prototyping.</p>
                   <br>
            <h4>Mechatronic Apprectice (August 2017 - August 2019)</h4>
                <p>In this role I obtained Greenville Technical college associate's degree in Mechatronics. Throughout the school week I would return to work to train with the maintenance team. 
                   I also took MEC 299 course offered which was a research class that me and a small team took a decommissioned panel with a Powerflex drive and an Allen Bradley processor and 
                   connected it to a conveyor. The conveyor used a light curtain for safety and photocells at which point would change the drive speed.</p>
            <h4>Michelin</h4>
            <h4>Mold Mechanic (August 2016 - August 2017)</h4>
                <p>Installed the curing press molds that would cure the tires. Repaired damaged areas inside the mold out on the line and in the shop. Rebuilt molds to be ready to install for 
                   Dimension Changes.</p>
            <h4>Bosch Rexroth</h4>
            <h4>Machinist Apprentice (July 2014 - August 2016)</h4>
                <p>In this role I learned to use all different types of machining equipment (Lathes, mills, grinders, etc) as well and learning CNC. I went was taking a course supplied by 
                    Greenville Technical college where we learned how to program CNC and use Cam software. Toward the end of the apprenticeship I was kept in the shop to work on a project to 
                    create this consumable part that protects a seal from the spline shaft on the hydraulic pumps. I hand wrote the CNC program to create these parts, around 30 different kinds, 
                    using macros to do the math for each piece versus writing different programs for each. Then created a work method for running the pieces. This saved the company about $75,000 
                    annually. I continued to work in the shop creating parts for the engineering team for the assembly lines.</p>
